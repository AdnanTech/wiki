Equations

linear equatins are a straight line graph

anything that isnt linear, wont be a straight line when drawn

*y = dy/dx x + c*

where y is the y value
dy/dx is change in y divided by change in x (gradient)
c is the y value in which x = 0, the y intercept

worksheet:
  * 1 - dy/dx = (11 - 8) / (3 - 2) = 3 therefore y = 3x + 2
  * 2 - dy/dx = (-4 - -3.5) / (3 - 2) = 0.5 therefore y = -0.5x - 2.5
  * 3 - y = ax^2 + bx + c

      using substitution:
      when x = 2, y = 1
      1 = 4a + 2b - 1
      2 = 4a + 2b
      b = 1 - 2a

      when x = 4, y = 7
      7 = 16a + 4(1 - 2a) - 1
      4 = 8a
      a = 1/2

      therefore b = 1 -1 = 0, thus y = 1/2x^2 - 1

  * 4 - y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
      d = 1
      
      when x = 2, y = -1
      -1 = 16a + 4b + 2c + 1
      8a + 2b + c = -1

      when x = 1, y = -1
      -1 = a + b + c + 1
      -2 = a + b + (-(8a + 2b + 1))
      -1 = -7a -b
      1 = 7a + b
      
      8a + 2(1 - 7a) + c = -1
      8a + 2 - 14a + c = -1
      -6a + c = -3
      3 + 6a = c
      
      8a + 2(1-7a) + (3 + 6a) = -1
      8a + 2 - 14a + 3 + 6a = -1
