  Style Rules for c programming
  500 word evaluatioe ansi c so its not cross platform

We are using ANSI C, which is the basic form of C avalible cross platform, this limits us to CLI applications only

Reading list is given

Contact information is given on canvas for: Ramiz, Kingsley, and Richard

Programming languages we are going to learn, in order: C -> C++ -> Java

If on mac, the alternative to dev C++ is XCode

Microsoft Studo doesnt use standard ANSI C, so it is not cross platform

Notes on Dev C++:

There is no way to declare strings, you have to declare an array of characters that contain the string: char c[] = "c string";

Compiler options
