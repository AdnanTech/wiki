We a GNU Compiler for c code

Dev C++ is a portable ide

A non ide approach is to use clang on the mac

You cant comment with //, has to be /*

"" is for string literal
' is for a single character

You have to state void function_name(void), you have to state this when writing functions that donnny data types

Return 0 means no error code, even if you dons in, it is returned by default
Include stdio.h is also implicity added even if it is not added in the top

C has a lot of undefined behaviour as it is low level, so you mess around with memory locations
